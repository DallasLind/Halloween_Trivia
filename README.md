# Halloween_Trivia

### What is this project?
This is a simple 10 question trivia game themed around horror movies made just in time for Halloween! This is the first of my four capstone projects for the Software Engineering Immersive program for General Assembly.

### Languages Used
* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS

### Challenges
This was a surprisingly difficult project, but this was mainly due to me not understanding how to organize my questions and be able to retrieve the correct answer back. I wanted to make the questions more readible as well against the darker background so I tried to make some changes in that regard.

### Future Plans
* Add a results page to tally up the score so the quiz has a definitive end to it
* Make the theme toggle on and off instead of autoplay 
* Fix the heartbeat sound effect with the total on Github pages


### Additional Resources
* Used modernAlert.js to alter the look of the alert boxes
* Heartbeat sound effect is courtesy of [InspectorJ from FreeSound](https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/485076/)
* Purchased the Halloween Theme Song from Amazon
