# Halloween_Trivia

### What is this project?
This is a simple 10 question trivia game themed around horror movies made just in time for Halloween! This is the first of my four capstone projects for the Software Engineering Immersive program for General Assembly.

### Languages Used
* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS

### Challenges
This was a surprisingly difficult project, but this was mainly due to me not understanding how to organize my questions and be able to retrieve the correct answer back. I wanted to make the questions more readible as well against the darker background so I tried to make some changes in that regard.

### Future Plans
I would like to alter the design of the page overall since it's a bit simple. My priority was interactivity and functionality, but down the line I would like to make it more visually appealing. Additionally, add scoring and a timer that provides a scare or something if the player doesn't answer in the correct amount of time.
